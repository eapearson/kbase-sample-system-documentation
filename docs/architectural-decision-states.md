# Architectural Decision States

## Idea

This state is used for decisions which are just loose ideas that architects want to document so that they do not get lost. If a decision has the idea-state, then it cannot have any relationships to other decisions.

## Tentative

This state is used for decisions which are seriously considered by the architect.

## Decided

The decision reflects the current position of the architect and must be consistent with other decided decisions.

## Approved

This state is reached if a previously decided decision has been confirmed; for instance during a review or a customer meeting.

## Challenged

This state is applicable, if a stakeholder raises issues about a previously decided or approved decision.

## Rejected

A rejected decision is a decision that was challenged and has been removed from the current iteration of the architecture. For the sake of simplicity, we subsume Kruchten's Obsolesced-state under this state as well.
