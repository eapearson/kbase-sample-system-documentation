# Decision Relations

## Depends on

If decision B depends on decision A, then B cannot be decided or approved without A being in that state. Expressed the other way round, A is a prerequisite for B. This relationship includes Kruchten's cases in which decision B is part of a decomposition of A, or if B is comprised by A.

## Caused by

If decision B is caused by decision A, then B would not have been decided without A being decided. This relationship expresses causality, without imposing further constraints on the decisions.

## Is excluded by

Decision A is excluded by decision B if A cannot be decided as long as decision B is decided. In other words decision B prevents decision A.

## Replaces

Decision B replaces decision A, if B was put into practice instead of A.

## - Is alternative for

If decision B is an alternative for decision A, then B was considered as design option instead of A. Two decisions are alternatives when they address a significant common set of concerns.
